## Overview

Panel is a web service that serves as UCLA Radio's main internal information tracking and management site.

**Note**: This spec is not complete and is constantly being revised.

## Users

All users of Panel should be current active members of UCLA Radio. However, within that category, there are a couple different types of UCLA Radio members:

1. **Interns** are members of Radio who have just joined. They don't have shows, but need access to all radio internal forms and music library.
2. **DJs** are members of Radio who have a current show. They need to be able to access all internal radio knowledge, as well as create and update information about their show.
3. **Managers** are the members of Radio who lead a department. They should be able to update their respective department's information and links.
4. **Admins** should be able to update any show, department information, moderate chats. The current web manager(s), assistant general manager, and the general manager should all be admins.
